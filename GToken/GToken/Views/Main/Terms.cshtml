                Payment and transactions to participating merchants affiliated to GToken will be conducted solely between the GWallet
                holder of the GWallet and the transacting merchant. Payment in form of GoPlay Tokens will be deducted from the participating
                User’s GWallet as and when the transaction is successful. Refer to 3.4 should the Transaction be refused. <br><br>

                <strong>3.6 Merchant Processing Delay.</strong> <br><br>

                When you send a payment to certain merchants, you are providing an Authorization to the merchant to process your
                payment and complete the transaction. The payment will be held as pending until the merchant processes your payment.
                Some merchants may delay processing your payment. In such an instance, your Authorization will remain valid for up to
                30 Days. <br><br>

                <strong>4.1 Balances.</strong> <br>
                You do not need to maintain a Balance in your GWallet in order to possess a GWallet. If there is a Balance in your
                GWallet, it will expire in 365 days pending on the date when the GoPlay Tokens has been purchased and charged into the
                GWallet. <br><br>

                maintaining and making available of information of the GWallet for investigation if any. Users may however make
                limited changes to specific GWallet particulars deem non-conflicting with the Privacy Policies and Users Agreement

                <strong> 10.5 No Warranty.  </strong><br><br>

                GTOKEN, OUR PARENT, EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS PROVIDE OUR SERVICES "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION,
                EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. GTOKEN, OUR PARENT, EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED
                WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  <br><br>

                GToken does not have any control over the products or services that are paid for with our Service and GToken cannot
                ensure that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction.  <br><br>

                GToken does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our Service, and operation of our site may be
                interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.  <br><br>

                GToken will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests and transaction involving the use of GToken Physical
                Scratch Cards and Merchants’ transaction mechanism (E-payments) involving GToken are processed in a timely manner but
                GToken makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because our
                Service is dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as technical difficulties experienced by GToken’s
                Internet Providers, User’s Internet Providers as well as other online third parties involvement in internet
                functionality. Some countries do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not
                apply to you. This paragraph gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from
                countries to countries.  <br><br>

                <strong> 10.7 Indemnification. </strong> <br><br>

                You agree to defend, indemnify and hold GToken, its parent, officers, directors and employees harmless from any claim
                or demand (including attorneys' fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this
                Agreement and/or your use of the Services. <br><br>

                <strong> 10.8 Complete Agreement. </strong> <br><br>

                This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between you and GToken with respect to the Service. Sections 1, 7,
                10 and 14, as well as any other terms which by their nature should survive, will survive the termination of this
                Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck
                and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.  <br><br>
